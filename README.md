It&#39;s a browser extension that draws that little bar on the left side that suggests that two tweets are part of the same thread, but next to two random tweets on your timeline. <a href="https://t.co/fuAojLlxSf">pic.twitter.com/fuAojLlxSf</a></p>&mdash; jordan @ ~/ (@j6m8) <a href="https://twitter.com/j6m8/status/1254066062049460224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 25, 2020</a></blockquote>
